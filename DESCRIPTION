    the wheel.

Description: Before, I always write some pieces of code abitrarily and throw
    them away after use it, and no long later I fogot where they are or couldn't
    understand them when I want to do the same thing again such as draw a simple
    plot, and I had to write the code again in the end, which spend my so much time.
    Now I decide to record all my code which may would be use again, so as not to
    rebuild the wheels time after time, moreover I can even share them with others
    who need. Thanks to Rstudio, Hadley Wickham and github, now I'm able to and
    decide to write it as an R package and manage it on github, thus I can promote
    my code style, use my R script on other strange computer and share with others
    more conviniently.
